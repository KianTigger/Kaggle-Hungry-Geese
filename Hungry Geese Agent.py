#11 columns of 7 rows, can move from 1st column to 11th column and 1st row to 7th row.
#Minimum of 2 food units on board at all times.
#Every 40 steps goose loses segment.
#The reward is calculated as the current turn + goose length.
#Surviving agents at the end of the episode receive maximum reward as (2 * episode steps) + length.
#200 steps each turn.
#Surviving agents receive maximum reward 2âˆ—configuration.episodeSteps.

#They both die, but the shorter one dies first. If it's down to the last two geese and your's is longer, 
# a head-on collision will end the game with you in first place.
#Not sure if this helps too much


#Need to think of a good way to incorporate last move for our goose and others geese as it's important in determining smallest steps to get to food etc.


## TO DO LIST ##

#take into account distance other geese have to travel using a* algorithm

#check open spaces around food before distance to see if it is viable ( to stop getting trapped as easily)

#If no suitable food available, a* to our tail, will need to create a matrix without our tail in it, should be relatively trivial.
